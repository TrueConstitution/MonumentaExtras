## 2.0 Release

Monumenta Extras has officially exited beta.

* The project is now open-source under the MIT license.
* Completely refactored internal implementations of many features.
* Config system is completely rehauled, now uses Cloth Config's AutoConfig for most options.
* Most maintainable features have been moved from the beta versions to this refactored version, albeit there may be some functionality lost.
* Changelog is now manual
* Old code for versions other than 1.20.4 has been dropped, so most versions will now only have 1.20.4
  * If you need another version, either pull request and port it yourself or create a support request and wait
