Reporting Issues
----------------

Search the [issue list](https://github.com/TrueConstitution/MonumentaExtras/issues) to see if your suggestion/bug was already reported. Include closed issues in your search.

If it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:

- steps for reproducing the issue
- a detailed description of the issue, including applicable logs/crash reports

Please place logs either in a [code block](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) or upload them as a plain text file.

Please note that some files could contain "sensitive" information. You are responsible for censoring information such as your computer name from your log file. 
Do note that overcensoring information such as JVM details and System details can, at times, lead to your issue being dismissed due to a lack of information.
